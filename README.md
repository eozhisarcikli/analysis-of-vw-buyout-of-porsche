# Analysis of Volkswagen Buyout of Porsche

I'll try to analyze the data leading up to the Volkswagen buyout of Porsche. I'll compare what models describe the stock best before and after each announcement 
and comment on the results.

I am going to directly get the data from Yahoo!Finance instead of importing a fixed data set. The ticker names for them are "VOW3.DE" and "PAH3.DE". 
Of course, the ".DE" at the end indicates that this data was recorded from the German stock market. As you know, there are other markets where these stocks 
are exchanged, but choosing the German one makes the most sense, since both companies are German based. Finally, 
market benchmark would be some other automobile producer selling stocks on the German market, so BMW("BMW.DE") seems like an obvious choice. Please be aware that the 
code will automatically import all the available values up to today.
